How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I tried my best to simplify the way I wrote programs. I tried to be as descriptive and direct as possible as if I was giving the work to someone who was new to the field. I feel I am still new to all of this so keeping things as simple as possible helps me connect work later on when projects are not still fresh in my mind. I feel everything I work on helps me build my knowledge for the future, that includes the CRUD work I did for this course.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by doing research and asking questions. Especially not being the most knowledgable in this field, it always helps to pick other peoples' brains. I try to approach each project one step at a time and make the work for myself as simple as possibly so that I do not get overwhelmed. I feel with each assignment I do in any class, I learn a little more about how to retain knowledge and make myself work more efficiently. I will definitely take my work, phsysically with me to help aid me in learning what not to do, and where I can improve on. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists find the most efficient ways to complete tasks. This matters because the more efficient and skilled work and tasks are completed, the more the entire field advances. I feel I am still learning, I would like to think my motivation and persistence would help any project I work on, even if i'm still not very knowledgable.
